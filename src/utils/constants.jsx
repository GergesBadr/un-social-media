          In 2006, Aza Raskin invented the infinite scroll feature, before this
          time, there was no infinite scroll like today, there was a fixed
          amount of content displayed on the homepage of social media platforms
          or search engines like Google, and when the user gets to the bottom,
          they see a <strong className="underlined-word">pagination</strong>{" "}
          with pages numbers to go to next or previous page.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most impressive thing about it is based on the concept of the{" "}
          <strong className="underlined-word">Surprise</strong>, in ourselves,
          we keep scrolling because we ‚ÄúWish‚Äù or ‚ÄúThink‚Äù that the next content
          is going to be more interesting, more satisfying, and better by any
          means.
        </p>
        <p>
          But that's simply an illusion, and if we keep thinking like this we
          will never stop scrolling because it's simply endless, we will still
          think that the next content might give us another

          Attention itself is how we decide to use/spend our mental energy.
          Imagine that you are in a dark room and have a flashlight, wherever
          the flashlight is pointing, your attention will be. According to

          At the ‚ÄúHook Model‚Äù, we discussed the triggers that have been designed
          to grab our attention to consuming more social media. But fortunately,
          it's a double-edged sword, we can use it in our favor.
        </p>
        <p>
          So,

            {" "}
            <i>turn off the notifications</i>
          </strong>{" "}
          for most of the apps that you consume a lot, only keep the important
          ones, like WhatsApp or email notifications if your work depends on
          that, apart from that, any notification you receive from Facebook,
          Instagram, or TikTok, etc‚Ä¶ is definitely not that important and does
          not worth your distraction and you can deal with it later.

          an urgent something is happening now and you should see it!{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          This will reduce how many times you click on the apps, therefore, the

          As much as possible, they are trying to make your experience easy
          before and while using those apps, so, if our intention is the
          opposite of theirs, we simply need to make it hard. This can achieved
          in many ways:

              <i> Reorder the apps </i>{" "}
            </strong>
            , do not put social media apps on the home screen, instead gather
            all of them in one folder and put it in a hard place to find, you
            can also name the folder a negative name like: ‚ÄúTime Waste‚Äù so that
            when you read it you remind yourself with everything we talked
            about.
          </li>

            Using a time tracker app,{" "}
            <strong className="text-custom-yellow">
              {" "}
              <i> add a usage limit </i>{" "}
            </strong>{" "}
            for the apps, this will force you to use the app only for the time
            you specified daily, for example, one hour or 30 mins. After this
            time, you won't be able to use the app again at the end of the day.
            (Unless you delete the usage limit)
          </li>
          <li>
            You can also{" "}
            <strong className="text-custom-yellow">
              {" "}
              <i> add a session limit </i>{" "}
            </strong>
            , this will allow you to specify the maximum amount of time you want
            to spend on the app ‚Äúeach session‚Äù or for every time you open it.
            This can help against the problem of infinite scrolling and the fact
            that we don't realize how much time we spent scrolling until now‚Ä¶

          We really don't need to follow up about everything going on around us,
          that's false or negative knowledge/seeing because we can't interact
          with it, we can't take any action towards it. It makes us negative
          viewers, we just consume, we don't contribute to it, we don't have any
          impact.

          The best way I would like to deal with social media is to use it and
          get what I want to get then immediately get out! To achieve it and not
          get distracted from the news feed or anything else, You can use only
          your PC or Laptop with social media, not a smartphone. Install the
          <ResourceLink

          >
            News Feed Eradicator Extension{" "}
          </ResourceLink>{" "}
          in your browser, this will delete the news feed from social media
          websites, allowing you to go, do whatever you really want to, and
          leave.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's a good trick because we simply can't fight all of those
          algorithms and designs and the big tech companies with our willpower
          only, that would be a non-fair fight. We can't say that: I am aware of
          the dark side of social media, but I am just going to use it for a
          short time‚Ä¶ that's a lie, you won't. So, get help from something else,
          like the tools we already mentioned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider deactivating or even deleting your social media accounts,
          maybe for some apps, not all of them. That's one of the strictest
          actions you can take. Be sure that after doing so, you won't miss
          anything, you won't be bored, you won't lose entertainment or anything
          like that‚Ä¶
