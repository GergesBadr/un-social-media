      <p>
        After all of this, we would think that the best solution is to delete
        all our social media apps/accounts. But that’s not right, at least not
        for everyone. We discussed how those tools manipulate us, we talked
        about the dark side, ignoring the benefits, because we all know them, we
        know how these tools play a crucial part in “making the world a small
        village” and connect us, despite how many people have their business
        depend on social media, etc…
      </p>

      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>
          So, let's be realistic here, If a tool has a lot of cons, then we have
          three options to deal with it:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-inside list-decimal space-y-2 marker:font-bold marker:text-indigo-600">
          <li>
            Continue using it (despite the harm it causes) in this case, the
            pros should be more than the cons
          </li>
          <li>
            Continue using it and try to avoid or fix its cons. Here, we suppose
            that the pros are worth our effort for fixing its cons
          </li>
          <li>Stop using it, and that's if the cons are more than the pros</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>
        For social media, I believe that the best choice we have is to get the
        most out of it, while being aware of its dark side and protecting
        ourselves.

      <p>
        Also, consider that your addiction is not your responsibility alone, so,
        don't blame yourself. They have intentionally designed and created these
        platforms just to be addicted.
