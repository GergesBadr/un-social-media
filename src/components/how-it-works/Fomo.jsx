      <p>
        FOMO is an abbreviation for Fear Of Missing Out, and it's one of the
        biggest reasons why we don't want to quit social media. And the most
        likely answer you would hear after asking someone why are you using
        social media is: Because I don't want to <strong>"miss out"</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We think if we reduced our usage, we would not be aware of what's going
        on with our friends or our world. In your mind, it may seem that
        everyone is having an amazing experience and lives and you're the one
        who is missing out.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have to consider that everyone shares only their highlighted moments
        in their life on social media, almost no one would prefer to share their
        daily 8-hour job details, it's boring and not interesting…
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem happens when we start to compare our “regular” life with the
        highlights of others' lives, and that's something totally not fair! It
        would make us feel stressed and not happy.
